	<h1>HISTORY</h1>
	<section>
	<p>
	Millikin wrestling on the Millikin university website has much data as from 2015. So, we are going to talk about them from 2015-today.  But they have NCAA appearances records that show that Millikin wrestling has been around since 1966 and they have been making appearances ever since then for numerous years. They have a lot of records from the past as well as today. The program was still growing when I was a freshman as I can remember but when they started, they started big and got some big wins and conference titles. They have built the foundation to where they are now.

	<h1>THIS SEASON</h1>
	<section>
	<p>
	This season they have had a great year and have finished at a nice win over loss ratio. There had made their way to regionals and had lost from their but over the years they have always made it as far and even more than that as champions and have many sectional regionals and semi state championships. This program shows that they are a winning program and will continue their hot streak as they recruit new players to carry the torch that the seniors have left.

	<h1>FUTURE</h1>
	<section>
	<p>
	The future for the team is still looking bright. They have always have a hot streak at winning and as they get more recruits and see how they are as a team and it's not individual at all. Everyone really has respect for each other and wants everyone to be a champion at their weight class. They will always be a winning wrestling team because they have a great coach and a great attitude from former players and past players that still help out the program.
