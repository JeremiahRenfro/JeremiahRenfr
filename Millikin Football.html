	<h1>HISTORY</h1>
<section>
	<p>Millikin University opened its doors in 1903. Athletic programs got an early start, as well as the Nickname "Big Blue". The "Big Blue" is generally attributed to Carl Head, a professor of mechanical engineering who used the name on posters during the 1916 Football season. Millikin joined the College conference of Illinois (CCI) on April 26, 1946. The CCI was later renamed to CCIW to recognize the 2 Wisconsin schools. Football was among the sports here at Millikin alongside baseball.</p>

	<h1>FUTURE</h1>
<section>
    <p>In the future, Coach Hall plans on sticking with the plan of script if changing the overall Vibe of the team. He brings a new energy that is very different from the previous years. He cares more about his players off the field and in the classroom than a regular coach. He wants his players to be the best person that they be. He stresses that recruitment is very important for the development of the program and to bring in this new, winning culture. With all these things in play, there is no doubt that it is only Up from here.
