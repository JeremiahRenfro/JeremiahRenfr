	<h1>HISTORY</h1>
	<section>
	<p>
	Millikin Womans Basketball first started in 1970 with only a few games to start their first start of their season. The past they were a decent basketball team and had competed for many titles throughout the time they have been playing basketball. This is defiantly a competitive team and not just a group of students who play basketball but a culture like sense and they love the game that they do their absolute best on the court.

	<h1>THIS SEASON</h1>
	<section>
	<p>
	This season they are competing for the national title for D3. They had an amazing year staying undefeated and hopefully using that to move on the to the rest of their games they have left of their season. They had broken many records that were held by prior players and the head coach has many accolades to show her time as coach. The program is looking really nice with their accolades and how they also have fun while they do it.

	<h1>FUTURE</h1>
	<section>
	<p>
	The future for the womans basketball team looks bright as they have gotten more recruits and many young players on the team already that have played and make a big role in the game. They will constantly stay at a high level of basketball as long as they keep doing what they do and don't let nothing get into their heads.
